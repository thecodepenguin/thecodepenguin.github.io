RSS (Rich Site Summary) or more commonly known as **Real Simple Syndication** is a
web feed format used to consume online content, both text and multimedia based.
In other words, it's a way to queue up and serve content from the Web. The
Codepenguin RSS for example, queues up all the articles that you have not seen
since you were last here. It's a great way to keep up with blogs and it's the
backbone of podcast distribution.

Until ten or so years ago it was the standard way of consuming most of the
information on the web. You went to a news website, clicked "Follow" and you
would get updated on any new article they would post. This was facilitated by
the fact that most web browsers at the time had some sort of an RSS baked in by
default. Unfortunately, this is not the case anymore.

The widespread use of social networks, especially Twitter and Facebook made RSS
fall out of favor because people started using social networks as a source for
all their web consumption instead. It's also easy to understand why that would
happen: social networks draw people in with the promise of online social
interaction and once you create an account, following a page to get all their
new content on your feed is only one click away. This process is easy and with
the added benefit of being able to comment on and share various articles with
people who follow you.

Commenting, liking, sharing, and pretty much interacting with any content online
is an essential part of Web 2.0. This is also the way that sites themselves
track and monetize their content.

Facebook provides content consumption, or better yet, **curated** content
consumption mixed in with social features. What you see in your Facebook or
Twitter feed is curated, not by people but by algorithms. RSS on the other hand
is pure content, managed and curated by the user themselves. There are no
comments, no likes, no algorithms that choose what to suggest you. You, the user
choose what you want to see and you will only be able to consume that content.
That's it. There's no interaction with the content whatsoever.

The algorithms that are being used to do content curation on various social
networks are unreliable at best. Take out the interaction part and you are left
with feeds filled with cat pictures, doubtful articles shared by people you
follow, pictures of friends, news articles, and the occasional good content that
you would want to read. With all the noise out there chances are you will not
find most of the things you want to be reading.

That's where RSS shines: you subscribe to the feeds you want and it will
queue up all the new articles since you last opened your RSS client. Say you
go on vacation for a couple of days, going back to Twitter to see what you
missed means navigating a sea full of trash, while your RSS client has
everything archived and ready for you to skim through and easily find what
you wouldn't have wanted to miss. RSS is excellent in that regard. 

You most likely have tons of websites you want to keep up with, but checking
each and every one of them every day is unfeasible. Fortunately, even today
most websites offer RSS feeds for their content. Wordpress, Blogger, and
most static site generators have built-in RSS feeds by default (you have to
go out of your way to disable it). This way, you can subscribe to all the
websites whose content you don't want to miss, and every time there's a new
article posted you will be sure to see it, regardless of how rare or
infrequent new posts are.

However, it's also very easy to follow hundreds of RSS feeds some of which
might publish tens of articles in a day an find yourself overwhelmed with
thousands of unread items the next time you open your client. But this is
mostly an issue with the mindset of the user and the reader that one uses
instead of the RSS format itself. A good RSS reader should let you skim all
the titles as easily as possible, in order for you to choose what to spend
time reading and what to skip. On the other hand, the user themselves must
come to terms with the fact that there's too much information to be consumed
by one person so it's important to understand what you want to read or not.
It's not like you will have fewer items to check on Twitter in case of a
relatively long absence for example. It's just the fact that we know how
most content on social networks is inherently without value and there's no
need to be up to date at all times.
