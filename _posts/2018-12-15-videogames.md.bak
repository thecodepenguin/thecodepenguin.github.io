title: "Video games as art"

While spending some time on Youtube, watching your run-of-the-mill
time-wasting videos, I came across a video that listed the "Game of
the Year" winners from 1980 through 2018. So I clicked on it with the
intent of seeing how many of them I could guess.

The guessing game soon turned into a trip down memory lane. Countless
hours spent amidst the vivid colors of the world of Super Mario, the
grey wastelands of Fallout, and the majestic scenery of The
Witcher. But as I was watching Joel trying to sneak past some bandits
in The Last of Us, I remembered how that game, for the first time in
my life made me feel like a video game had the potential to be as
powerful and as expressive as any piece of art in the world.

## Defining art

Defining art is an exercise in futility. It's not a surprise that
philosophers, thinkers, and artists have been trying to define it for
so long. The fact that art is so personal, to both the creator and
consumer, means that anyone who tries to define it will come up with a
purely personal and subjective definition.

There have been countless attempts to provide a theoretical definition
of art, going as far back as Plato<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> and continuing into the current
era. Some early definitions of art include:

* Art as imitation or representation.
* Art as a medium for emotional expression.
* Art as 'significant form'.

These definitions all have an immediate draw, but upon closer look one
can see that these views lacking. Usually, these definitions are
inhibited by the time period they were defined in. For example,
Plato's definition in The Republic<sup><a id="fnr.1.100" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>:

> [Socrates:] Which is the art of painting designed to be—an imitation
> of things as they are, or as they appear—of appearance or of reality?
> 
> [Glaucon:] Of appearance.
> 
> [Socrates:] Then the imitator…is a long way off the truth…

Shows that he (through Scorates) thinks of art (painting in this case)
as merely an imitation of nature, only in appearance and not in
essence. Which would make sense in the time period Plato lived
in. There was no photography back then and people used to paint scenes
of nature and other people in order to keep a visual memory of
them. Paintings at the time did not try to capture a particular
feeling, they only strived to be as faithful to reality (or what the
ancient Greeks thought of as ideal reality) as possible. But as time
passed and technology advanced, the camera was invented which made the
need for painting realistic scenery disappear. New forms of painting
arised, from Expressionism to Cubism to Dadaism. Art forms which
sought to capture feelings and expressions rather than trying to be
realistic and immitate only the appearance of nature. Does that mean
that Rembrandt or Picasso are not artists? Does this mean that
Picasso's Guernica is not a piece of art? Certainly not. The problem
is that Plato could not have predicted the invention of photography
and the artistic revolution that would follow it.

An important distinction to make when defining something as complex as
art is the one between nominal and real definitions. A nominal
definition defines the *idea* that a word stands for, while a real
definition defines what it is what that word refers to. In that way, a
real definition for a word X would identify a set of properties unique
to X and that only X has. For example, a real definition for *red*
would be that red constitutes the light waves with wavelengths in the
625-740 nanometer range. A nominal definition on the other hand,
states that red is the color associated with strawberries, heat, and
love.

Webster dictionary defines art as<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>:

> the conscious use of skill and creative imagination especially in the
> production of aesthetic objects

However, that is neither the *nominal* nor entirely the *real*
definition. A dictionary would try to give a real definition
everywhere it's possible. But in the case of art, it's especially hard
and dare I say, impossible to find a set of properties associated only
with what we consider art.

In *The Role of Theory in Aesthetics*<sup><a id="fnr.3"
class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>, Morris Weitz argues that any
real definition of art would fail because works of art are related to
one-another like an interconnected web of nodes than by some rigid and
unchaengeable set of properties. Works of art are more similar to a
family tree than a rigid and unchangeable set of creations. This
resemblance to a family was first advanced by Wittgenstein and it
proposes that groups given a common name and thought to be connected
by a common, essential feature are, rather, connected by a network of
overlapping features. The same way a family that shares
characteristics like: height, eye color, facial features, overlap and
criss-cross throughout the family tree.

By that logic, video games can be derived as a reasonable "family
member" of art forms that are generally accepted as such. For example,
movies or even graphic novels.

## Critics

Comparing video games to movies can sometimes be problematic. There are
similarities, of course. Most video games follow a strict,
pre-determined storyline. Sometimes there are different ways you can
reach the end of a story, or even different endings much like an
interactive movie where each player is the director of the movie they
are watching, or rather, participating in.

However, this great freedom can also be a hindrance in trying to
define whether video games are an art form or not. To take an example
from Roger Ebert, it would be as if *Romeo & Juliet* had an optional
happy ending. Such an ending, according to Ebert would hinder the
artistic expression and emotional weight of the original work<sup><a
id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>.

Another argument that Ebert posed against video games being art, is,
that a game has points, objectives, and rules<sup><a id="fnr.5"
class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>.

> One obvious difference between art and games is that you can win a
> game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome. Santiago might
> cite a [sic] immersive game without points or rules, but I would say
> then it ceases to be a game and becomes a representation of a story, a
> novel, a play, dance, a film. Those are things you cannot win; you can
> only experience them.

So, according to Ebert, the difference between a video game and a movie
is that you play the former to win and not to experience something
that was made just for being experienced. But a movie has rules as
well, rules that are constrained within the borders of storytelling. A
character in a movie, much like in a video game cannot break the rules
of the story. At least in a good movie that is. Aragorn cannot pull
out his cellphone to contact Frodo and ask him how his quest is
going. In that same way, Joel in *The Last of Us* cannot survive a
fall from a large height much like in real life. 

Surprisingly, another person who agreed with Ebert was Hideo Kojima,
arguably the most renowned and well-known video game designer today. He
argued that while video games may contain artwork, they aim to provide
100% player satisfaction, while art is targeted at least to one
person. Video Game creation, he argues, is more of a service than an
artistic endeavor<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref"
href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>. However, that argument would also disqualify
99% of movies and most musical albums being released today. In an
increasingly capitalistic world, even works of art are released with
the intention of maximizing both sales and consumer satisfaction. So
is it really fair to say that video games are not art solely on the
basis that video game designers make them with the aim of maximizing
sales? Can that assumption be made? Surely, video games released by big
publishers are released with the aim of maximum profit, but there must
be some indie developers who make games for the purpose of making
games.

On the other hand, there are plenty of art critics who have come in
the defense of video games as an art form. One of them is journalist
Patricia Hernandez, who, in an article about the game *Photopia*,
describes the solution of a puzzle which makes a reveal about the
playable character, prompting, according to Hernandez, experiences
that could not be "as powerful as they are" in any other art form
without interactivity<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref"
href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>. Storytelling in video games happens in the
present tense, and in first-person. In more ways than one, you are
*part* of the story. In that regard, there are many who consider
video games to be the ultimate art form.

Circling back to Weitz's definition of art forms being interconnected
with each-other through similarities much like a family-tree,
video games do not fit any rigid definition derived from looking at
existing works of art that are accepted as such. Instead, video games
have many similarities to story-driven and visual art forms while
creating something new through interactivity and first-person
storytelling.

It's hard to make predictions on where video games will go. They are an
artform in its infancy similar like cave paintings made by
pre-historic humans. But one thing is for sure, video games have opened
a new door and made it possible to explore new ways in which human
creativity can be used.
